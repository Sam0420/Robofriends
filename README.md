# 🤖 Robofriends

Robofriends is a simple and fun **React** app that displays a list of robot-themed friends and allows users to **search through them in real time**.

This project was built to practice React fundamentals such as **components**, **props**, **state**, and **event handling** — all while integrating a mock API and dynamic image generation.
